                        <p>Does being 19 years old and only a freshman in college prove to be a challenging moment in life to create a website life story?
                            Probably. Am I still going to try my best to showcase who I am? Of course I will.

                        <p>I graduated from Lone Peak Highschool with a 3.95 GPA and a 30 ACT. I was affiliated with National Honor Society, Service Club, Student Body, CTE pathways and TSA.</p>
                        <p>In Student Body, I served in the publicity position for 3 years and then for my final year I transitioned into the new position of Videographer. My job was to facilitate highschool environments that were welcoming to students, made others want to be involved, and were well documented to provide advertisement for future events put on by the school.</p>
                        <p>My involvement in CTE put me as head of videography at my highschool and led me to be in charge of the weekly show for the school as well as head a couple projects for competition in such places like the All American Highschool Film Festival. In this position I learned how to edit with Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop and Lightroom. Some of my <a href="pastwork.html">past work</a> includes me working on physical sets as well as some digital sets.</p>

                        <p>As boring as it sounds, its one of my greatest talents. I've taken care of schools, homes, yards, and even businesses. As of late it has even led me to start my own company <a href="http://carterlawncareUT.com">CarterLawnCareUT</a> that I am using to save up for a mission this fall.

                                                <p>I have been working as a Landscaper here at <a href="http://thepeac.com">The Peac</a> for the last 4-5 years of my life. In my position I was in charge of managing one of the nicest soccer fields in Utah valley.</p> 
                                                <p>In some of my <i>adventures</i> as a landscaper I learned everything there is to know about grass care. From fungal level management, acid treatment, thatching, straight lines, fertilizing and even learning to sharpen the blades before each mow, I now have the knowledge to have the greenest grass on the block when I am a dad in the future.</p>

                                                <p>As of a few months ago, I launched my own <a href="https://CarterLawnCareUT.com">landscaping company</a> emphasizing on doing the stuff other people wouldn't do with a higher level of communication that others couldn't provide.</p> 
                                                <p>The new company has been going phenomenal and me and my friend in just a few weeks have more work than we can even handle with minimal advertising. We even charge rates that I wouldn't think were even possible and I am incredibly happy to say that I should be able to finance my entire mission and a year of school with no debt thanks to one summer of this work. We do pretty much anything you could possibly have done, and we do it with an emphasis on educating the customer on the importance of it and how it can care for your lawn. Additionally we tackle other projects other companies in the area won't take on such as raw weeding and hand-spreading mulch. By doing this we have carved ourselves a niche quickly and effectively and it should lead to a fantastic summer of work.</p>

                        <p>One of the things I have always had a passion for is content creation. I first fell in love when my parents got me a knock off go pro camera for christmas one year when I was around 10 years old and I have never stopped since.</p>
                                    <h5 class="titlechanger">Uknighted, TSA, and Student Government</h5>
                                                <div>
                                                <p>As I previously mentioned, some of the places I have held a presiding role in content creation is in my highschool. During this time I competed in multiple competitions such as DECA, TSA, AAHSFF, and FBLA. All of these were for content creation with an emphasis on editing. I would take footage produced with my team and turn it into the final product using  my skills in Adobe Premier Pro.</p> 
                                                <p>One of the other amazing aspects of this was that in the position of Videographer for my student body, I was able to bring people happiness and a spotlight that they weren't normally accustomed to. I would go to events with a specific emphasis on showing off students who don't normally feel shown off and bring them their own spotlight. Another amazing aspect of carrying a camera is that when it turns on, people gravitate to you and this ability allowed me to connect with tons of people in my highschool and it helped me develop the ability to become friends with anyone rather quickly, with or without a camera.</p>

                                                <div>
                                                <p>One of the places my passion for content creation has taken me is the internet. Over the course of the last few years I have made a sizeable presence on the internet specifically with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lackoftalent_"> Tik Tok</a> <a href="https://twitch.tv/lackoftalent_">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/lack">Discord</a>.</p> 
                                                <p>This branch of myself has led to some of the greatest moments in my life. One thing I did with my internet presence was to invite other people who would normally be on their own or by themselves to join me and be apart of something fun. I would encourage people to put themselves out there when they weren't used to it, I would gift people spotlights infront of hundreds of people live on the internet when they deserved one but never found one. This platform and ability of mine lead to me even getting verified on discord, and lead to the ability to financially cover my last semester. Below this you will find an example of one of the styles of videos I created while doing this.</p>
